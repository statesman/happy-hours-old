# happy-hours

This is the old version of [Happy Hours](http://projects.statesman.com/happy-hours/) when it was built on Foundation. I reworked it under Bootstrap as a branch [rework](https://github.com/statesman/happy-hours-old/tree/rework), but decided not to merge as I wanted to retain this as a master branch. I guess for posterier posterity. Maybe that's stupid. So be it.

The new version is [happy-hours](https://github.com/statesman/happy-hours/).
